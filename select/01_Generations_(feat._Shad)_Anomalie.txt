Generations

Where I'm at

Looking back

I used to rap about the future
And it's weird how It's here now
And how we'll soon disappear
All our hopes, fears
The smoke and mirrors and sincere doubts
In a few years, will just be dust and cleared out
But for a minute we assist the transition
Give a hand then loosen our grip
Expand the vision past Instagram pics
To witness anguish and give a damn
And resist the ambition and just trick and scam systems
Is he spitting man? (Is he spitting?)
Uplifting fam sickest transcripts written
Since the Sanskrit languages
Simply cuz the fans of the kid demand different

I'm blessed
Yes Yes
Long as we're granted the chance
To keep advancing don't stress
We're blessed
Yes Yes
Long as you're standing on this planet
You're already a champion
Blessed
Yes Yes
Long as you're granted the chance
To keep advancing don't stress
We're blessed, Yes Yes
Long as you're standing on this planet
You're already a champion. Blessed

Break it down

Best to ever wander on a stage. Namaste
My Rwandan-made style is nonpareil
Brought up raised between Ronald Reagan and Obama's day
The genre's hey' Raekwon to Wayne on them drama tapes
I just synthesized my idols then I dropped like bombs away
Lobbed grenades on the page don't want my songs on a playlist
Unless it's with the best - Don McLean, Bonnie Raitt
Chaka Khan from the 80s, maybe Lady Marmalade
Andalay
Spit in Spanish, flex in French, and en Anglais
Play the fests in Montreux in Montreal and Monterrey
Then I'm on a plane gone away to where my mama stay
On a German airliner reclining like danke schon
Headliner all the hotels trying to accommodate
Compensated 'cause my contributions far from commonplace
I belong with the modern greats
How I conversate bare talent
Showing out like thongs and lingerie
That's blessed

Yes Yes
Long as you're granted the chance
To keep advancing don't stress
We're blessed
Yes Yes
Long as you're standing on the planet
You're already a champion
Blessed

Prayer and meditation
To try to stay aware of the snares they set in place
And bring care and dedication to repair our generation's
Inherited devastation —
Despair and medication
Rick Flair and Gary Payton and our parents' separations
We were brought up buried in a basement
It's layered
Just like America the great and the terror
Sharing space in the same precarious nation
I was young and dreaming of love
Like where's the demonstration?
Like who got next? (Who got next?)
We got next

Yes Yes
Long as we're granted the chance
To keep advancing don't stress
We're blessed
Yes Yes
Long as you're standing on this planet
You're already a champion blessed
Yes Yes
Long as you're granted the chance
To keep advancing don't stress
You're blessed
Yes Yes
Long as you're standing on this planet
You're already a champion
Blessed
Yes Yes
Long as you're granted the chance
To keep advancing don't stress
You're blessed
Yes Yes
Long as you're standing on this planet
You're already a champion

Don't stress
Yes Yes
Long as you're standing on this planet
You're already a champion
Blessed
