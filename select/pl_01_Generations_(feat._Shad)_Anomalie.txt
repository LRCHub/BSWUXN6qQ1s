Where I'm at
Looking back
I used to rap about the future
And it's weird how
It's here now…
And how we'll
soon disappear
All our hopes, fears
The smoke and mirrors
and sincere doubts
In a few years
Will just be dust
Then cleared out
But for a minute
We assist the transition
Give a hand
Then loosen our grip
Expand vision
Past Instagram pics
To witness anguish
And give a damn
Uplifting man
And Resist the ambition
To just trick and scam systems
Is he spitting? Man listen
Sickest transcripts written
Since the Sanskrit languages
Simply cuz the fans
of the kid demand different
I'm blessed
Yes Yes
Long as we're granted
The chance
To keep advancing
Don't stress
We're blessed
Yes Yes
Lon as you're standing
On this planet
You're already a champion
Blessed
Yes Yes
Long as we're granted
The chance
To keep advancing
Don't stress
We're blessed
Yes Yes
Lon as you're standing
On this planet
You're already a champion
Blessed
Best to ever wander on a stage
Namaste
My Rwandan-made
Style is nonpareil
Brought up raised between
Ronald Reagan
and Obama's day
The genre's hey(day)
Raekwon to Wayne
On them drama tapes
I just synthesized my idols
Then I dropped
like bombs away
Lobbed grenades on the page
Don't want my songs
on a playlist
Unless it's with the best-
Don mclean, bonnie raitt,
Chaka khan from the 80s
maybe Lady Marmalade
Andalay
spit in Spanish
Flex in French
and en Anglais
Play the fests
In Montreux in Montreal
and Monterrey
Then I'm on a plane
Gone away
to where my mama stay
On a German airliner
Reclining like Danke Shun
Headliner all the hotels trying
to accomodate
Compensated
'cause my contributions far
fromcommonplace
I belong with the modern greats
How I conversate
Bare talent
Showing out like thongs
and lingerie
That's blessed
Yes Yes
Long as you're granted
The chance
To keep advancing
Don't stress
We're blessed
Yes Yes
Long as we're standing
On the planet
You're already a champion
Blessed
Bless
prayer and meditation
To try to stay aware
of the snares they set in place
And bring care and dedication
To repair our generation's
inherited devastation —
Despair and medication
Rick Flair and Gary Payton
And our parents separations
We were brought up
Buried in the basement
It's layered…
Just like
America the great
and the terror
Sharing space in the same
Precarious nation
I was young
and dreaming of love
Like wheres
the demonstration?
Who get next
We got next
Blessed
Yes Yes
Long as you're granted
The chance
To keep advancing
Don't stress
Blessed
Yes Yes
Long as we're standing
On the planet
You're already a champion
Blessed
Yes Yes
Long as you're granted
The chance
To keep advancing
Don't stress
Blessed
Yes Yes
Long as we're standing
On the planet
You're already a champion
Blessed
Yes Yes
Long as you're granted
The chance
To keep advancing
Don't stress
Blessed
Yes Yes
Long as we're standing
On the planet
You're already a champion
Don't stress
Yes Yes
Long as we're standing
On the planet
You're already a champion
Blessed
